*Why preform a simple task in a simple way, when you can preform a simple task in a _complex_ way?*

Machine Learning has been applied to a range of complex and pressing problems: [identifying cancer tumors](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2016/11/identifying-skin-cancer-computer-vision/) and [classifiying particle collsions](https://www.nature.com/news/artificial-intelligence-called-in-to-tackle-lhc-data-deluge-1.18922). However, has anybody ever applied these statistical methods to the addition of two single digit integers? Today, we step into the bold unknown!

### Motivations:

I undertook this project to explore different types of linear models. Additionally, I wanted to complete a project, start-to-finish, within the span of one saturday afternoon.
